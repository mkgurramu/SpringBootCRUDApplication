SpringBootCRUDApplication

Hi All,


Following is the Github URL for the corresponding project:


https://github.com/mkgurramu/SpringBootCRUDApplication

 

https://github.com/mkgurramu/SpringBootCRUDApplication

 

Please find attached proof of concept for project developed using hibernate, spring 4, spring boot, XSLT and CSS & HTML.

 

This also consists of CRUD operations like save, update and delete.

 

Application outline:

 

Use case :  Student info

    Application should gather the student details like name, no, class, address etc.. and save into database. Class should be drop down
    Application should display default student info (i.e. at least two student’s info) during initial setup phase.
    Saved student information should be updatable via “Edit” link against student name.
    Student number should be unique and app shouldn’t allow duplicates.
    Need a separate screen/pop-up  to dynamically add/modify class and should display already added Classes.
    All the columns (i.e. name, no, class, address etc..) have a sorting option facility to sort it at UI page.
    UI should support responsive UI facility and along with all the acceptable validations.
    Feel free to add any additional functionality.

 

Task :

1.       Build the spring boot +  MVC maven application (including CRUD operations along with UI pages).

2.       Preferably single page application and UI pages must produce HTML (i.e. not JSP pages)

3.       Spring security authentication for sign-in (i.e. optional)

4.       Application should be implemented via layered architecture.

5.       Exposed services (i.e. APIs ) should accessible thru postman.

6.       Above application must satisfy following scenarios

a.       clean-code principles

b.       unit test case coverages

c.       exceptions handling

d.       server & client side validations.

e.       Support internalization (i.e. Label names must be taken from prop file)  [Optional]

 

Technologies :

              Java  1.8

              Junit & mokito unit test cases (optional:  mokito)

              Spring Boot + MVC

              Rest services/API + json

              Hibernate (for data retrieval and saving)

             Angular/ jQuery + java script + boot strap

              XML & parsing and XSLT

 

Thanks,
